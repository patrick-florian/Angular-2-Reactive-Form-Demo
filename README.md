# Demoform

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.0.

Hey there it's Pat :) ... boring stuff below. 

## Quick Start
I have bootstrap installed globally in this pacakge via NPM so you may wanna run an npm install from the project root. Clone the project (it's public shouldn't be any issues) then go to the root of the project and run a ng serve. Finally navigate to localhost:4200 (by default) and you should see the project landing page with a couple of links to various forms.

!!! It will not look visually appealing btw, this is just to flex my backend coding skills. Although someday I shall clean it up when I have the time

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
